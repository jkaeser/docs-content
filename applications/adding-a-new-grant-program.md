Build an application form for a program by adding fields to the application type. The application types are created automatically when a new program is added.

There are three steps to adding a field:

* Adding the field's data settings (this section)
* Configuring the display of the field on the application form ([Managing Form Display](/docs/applications/managing-form-display))
* Configuring the display of the field when viewing an application ([Managing Application Display](/docs/applications/managing-application-display))

For an example of the entire process, see [the Getting Started section](/docs/getting-started#add-field-to-application).

First, we must add the field's data settings at 'Manage Fields.'

Go to **Application Management > Manage Application Types > 'Application Type Name' > Manage Fields**.

On the 'Manage fields' page you see all the fields on your application. Press the 'Add Field' button to add a new field. You can add a new field or reuse an existing field. Reusing a field can help you save time if you are collecting the same information on multiple application forms.

To Add a field, choose a field type for the type of data it will hold, enter in the label for the field, and press ‘Save and Continue’ to start configuring the Field Settings.
