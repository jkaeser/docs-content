Each application will have a 'Status' to indicate its progress through your workflow. The default workflow goes like:

![Application workflow](/img/sm8gmqdrhfjmm_jo75xjd9a.png)

The application begins with status of '**In Progress**.' In this status, the applicant can edit the application and does not need to fill in all required fields yet.

Once the applicant submits their application, and the application is valid (all required fields filled in), its status changes to '**Submitted**.' If the cycle is still open, the applicant can still edit the application in that status, but doing so sets it back to 'In Progress.' When the application changes to 'Submitted' the PDF version of the application is generated, allowing the applicant (and reviewers/staff) to download a copy of their application.

If the application is still in 'In Progress' when the cycle ends, the application automatically becomes '**Expired**.'

When the cycle ends, a staff person should manage the applications by going to 'Manage Application Cycles' -> 'Applications' (for the cycle) -> 'Bulk Editing'. Here she can manually set applications to the **'Approved for Review' **status. (She can alternatively change statuses by editing an application.) While in 'Approved for Review' reviewers assigned to the cycle will be able to review the applications.

Finally a staff person should assign each 'Approved for Review' application to either '**Award Granted**' or '**Denied**' status via the Bulk Editing page or by editing each application. If you set the Cycle to 'List on Past Awards Page' then applications in status of 'Award Granted' will be listed in the Past Awards section.
