Applications can be exported in bulk in CSV and PDF format. Each cycle’s ‘All Applications’ and ‘Approved for Review’ pages have download buttons at the bottom of the page for CSV (‘CSV’) and PDF (‘Download All Applications’).

**CSV**

CSV format can be opened by Excel or Google Sheets, letting you analyze application data there.

**PDF**

The PDF export gives you a zip file containing a PDF for each application. This can be used to review the applications offline or to archive as an additional backup.
