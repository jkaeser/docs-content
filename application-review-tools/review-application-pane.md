When an application has 'Approved for Review' status it will have a link to '**Review Application**' for editors and reviewers. It opens a panel that you can keep open while viewing the application.

The **application navigation** at the top of the Review pane lets you quickly navigate applications in the Cycle that are 'Approved for Review.'

Reviewers can fill in a numeric **Score** from 1-10 for the application in the Score field, and can change their score.

Reviewers can check '**Mark as Reviewed**' to keep track for themselves which applications they've reviewed.

Editors can see the **Average, Minimum, and Maximum scores** on the application and can open up '**Reviewer Scores**' to see each reviewer's individual score.

Reviewers and editors can add **comments**, which will display within this Review pane. Editors have the option to uncheck '**Display comment to reviewers**' in order to add comments to applications which only other editors can see.
