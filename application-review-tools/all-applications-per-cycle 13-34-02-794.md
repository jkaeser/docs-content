You can use the 'Status' filter to filter applications. Click the headers on the table to change the sort.

Below the table are buttons for downloading a CSV of the applications for viewing in Excel and to 'Download All Applications.' 'Download All Applications' gives you pdf exports of all applications in the cycle. See [CSV and PDF Exports](/docs/application-review-tools/csv-and-pdf-exports).
