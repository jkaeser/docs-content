Users need the role of 'Applicant' in order to create applications. To become an applicant, a user must:

* Create an account on the site. They can go to 'Log In' at the top right of the site and then to the 'Create new account' tab or they can find a link to 'Create Account' on the 'Getting Started' page once a Cycle is open.
* Verify their email address by clicking a link in an email they then receive. This is necessary to reduce spam accounts.
* Complete their user profile and press 'Request Approval.'
* Be manually assigned the Applicant role by an Editor.
