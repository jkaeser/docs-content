An editor is a staff person who can manage the site.

Editor accounts have a lot of ability to change the site, so be sure your editors are careful with their accounts. This means:

* Use a strong and unique password. Use of a password manager such as LastPass is recommended.
* Be careful with logged in sessions. Do not leave your account logged in on an unattended computer.
* Block editor accounts when staff leave your organization. We recommend preparing a checklist of online services your organization uses (email accounts, etc.) for use when a staff member leaves so that you do not forget to block accounts.
