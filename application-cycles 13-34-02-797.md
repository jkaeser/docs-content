Application cycles are periodic (typically annual) application rounds for a program. For example, if your program is ‘Performing Arts Program’, you may have cycles for ‘2017 Performing Arts Program’ and ‘2018 Performing Arts Program’. Cycles are used for scheduling when applications can be created on the site.

Manage cycles at **Application Management > Manage Application Cycles**

Here you can find a list of your cycles grouped by program, including their application period and current status. The status is based on the application period. If the application period has not yet begun the status will be **Pending**. If it has begun but not ended the status will be **Open**. If it has ended the status will be **Closed**. You can view a cycle, edit a cycle, or create a new cycle here.

The homepage and the programs page will update automatically to show cycles that are **Pending** or **Open**. Applicants will be able to create applications for Open cycles.
