To reveal all submenus related to your user account, click on the 'Account' menu.  To collapse the 'Account' submenus, click on the 'Account' menu again.  

By default the Admin Toolbar will appear at the top of the page with a horizontal orientation.  The Admin Toolbar can also appear as a left sidebar menu with a vertical orientation.  To change the Admin Toolbar's orientation to vertical, click on the 'Manage' menu to reveal its submenus.   Then, click on the 'horizontal orientation' arrow button.
