Programs are ongoing programs your foundation runs. Each one will correspond to a specific application type with its own application form. Your foundation may have only one program, or multiple.

Programs will be listed automatically on your homepage and on your /programs page.

Manage programs at **Application Management > Manage Application Programs**.

Here you can find a list of your siteâ€™s programs with links to edit them or add a new program.

When you add or edit a program you can control the text describing the program to your applicants.
