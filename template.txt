This is where you add the page copy. See https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ for help writing with Markdown.

If you would like to add an image, first upload it to the "media" folder. You could add the image somewhere else if you'd like, but putting all images in "media" will help keep your file management neat. Then, include the relative path to the image file in the image markdown syntax. For example:

![The image's alt text](media/image.png)
