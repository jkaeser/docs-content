You can quickly get your own ApplyCycle site by filling out the Contact form at <https://applycycle.com/contact/>. You can use this site as a disposable demo site, or, if you are happy with the changes you make to it, we can keep them when youâ€™re ready for a live site at your custom domain. Canary.

This documentation assumes you have logged in to an ApplyCycle site with a user account with a role of 'Editor.'
